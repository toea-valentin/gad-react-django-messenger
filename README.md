# Live Chat Application

## Description

Created a full stack application: a chat app inspired by Whatsapp using Python (Django REST framework) and MySQL for the back-end part and React for front-end.
It contains a list of people that you can filter using the search bar, the list is updated in real time.
Once selected a person you can start chatting with them in real time.
Chat features:
- you can delete your own message, update that will also occur in real time.
- add reactions to the other person's messages: you can like their message or take back the like.
A person can send you a message even if you're not connected with them, it will automatically save it to database and you can check the message whenever you want.
All messages are saved to the database so you can still see old messages on a new instance.
Login and register pages added.
